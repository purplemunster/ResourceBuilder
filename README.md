# ResourceBuilder
D3D/Vulkan resource description builder implementation. ResourceBuilder is a helper class that can be used
to initialise a D3D resource descriptor either standalone or from an existing ID3D12Resource object. ResourceBuilder
includes methods that build RTV/DSV/SRV structures from an initialised D3D resource description.
